# Active-Directory-User-Group-Report
Generates a list of all users and group memberships in domain. Grid layout color coordinated disabled status.
This is a very basic project made with little Powershell, CSS, and HTML knowledge.

Recently at my work I was sent an email complaining that there are disabled users that still appear in distribution groups. This list is made to assist in cleaning up existing environments. Note that this script does not perform any automated removal of users from groups nor does it disable users.

Please let me know if there is a better way to generate HTML here, as I am very new to this.
