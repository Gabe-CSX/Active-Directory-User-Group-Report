# Active-Directory-User-Group-Report
Generates a list of all users and group memberships in domain. Grid layout color coordinated disabled status.
This is a very basic project made with little Powershell, CSS, and HTML knowledge.

Recently at my work, I was sent an email complaining that there are disabled users that still appear in distribution groups. This list is made to assist in cleaning up existing environments.
